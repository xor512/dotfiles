# How to change colorscheme

Open a terminal window, typing (not open mc, otherwise skin update doesnâ€™t apply). `mcedit .config/mc/ini`
Search for skin with F7 and change it. `skin=modarin256` is really nice for example.
Save and restart terminal. Look into `/usr/share/mc/skins/` to see the different themes.
