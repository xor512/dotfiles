# Restore session after crash

If Firefox has crashed or you've launched it and found out that open tabs are gone apart from pressing "Restore session" button you can also try:

        lz4jsoncat ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4 > output.json

# Other

* Use invidio.us instead of shitty Google player in Firefox (at least bluetooth doesn't stutter)

# TODO

* Try https://brave.com/
* Try more addons like uMatrix from https://www.linux.org.ru/forum/desktop/15821352?cid=15821366
