There are 3 themes for uniform GTK/Qt look:
 * adwaita
 * breeze
 * kvantum themes
(c) https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uniform_look_for_Qt_and_GTK_applications (see packages from there)

1. To configure theme for Gtk use lxappearance
2. To configure theme for Qt4 use qtconfig-qt4
   (not that Qt4 is deprecated for example in Manjaro and can be installed only
    from AUR, so to get qtconfig-qt4 or breeze-kde4 or such a lot of packages has to be
    installed from AUR, and as there are probably not many Qt4 apps left in repositories
    it may not be worth installing, so lxappearance + qt5ct may be enough)
3. To configure theme for Qt5 use qt5ct AND add this to .bashrc/.zshrc: export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
   (to check whether it is working run smth like QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct kdiff3 from terminal)
   (c) https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Qt#Configuration_of_Qt5_apps_under_environments_other_than_KDE_Plasma
4. For chromium go to Settings -> Use GTK+ theme
5. For QtCreator use Tools -> Options -> Environment and Tools -> Options -> Text Editors

For kvantum themes Kvantum Manager should be used instead (it has a lot of themes):
